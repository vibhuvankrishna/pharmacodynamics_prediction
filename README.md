Built an end-to-end ADMET prediction pipeline training CNN, RNN, LSTM models across 7 molecular descriptor combinations on 8 datasets, producing 168 models using ** MLflow** for extensive performance analysis and logging.
* Optimised the pipeline for ** GPU** rendering by leveraging ** WSL 2 Linux** virtual machines with CUDA ** cuDNN**, ensuring stable, reproducible, and ** XLA-safe** execution across heterogeneous training workloads.
